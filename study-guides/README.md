# Energy & Thermodynamics Study Guides
This is a collection of study guides that I created based on the text Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics, 8th Edition, Moran et al. These are useful for studying and brushing up on necessary material related to mechanical engineering.
#### Chapters covered include:

- Ch. 2: Energy and the First Law of Thermodynamics
- Ch. 3: Evaluating Properties
- Ch. 4: Control Volume Analysis Using Energy
- Ch. 5: The Second Law of Thermodynamics
- Ch. 6: Using Entropy
- Ch. 8: Vapor Power Systems
- Ch. 9: Gaw Power Systems
- Ch. 10: Refrigeration and Heat Pump Systems
